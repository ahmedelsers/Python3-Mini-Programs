# linux-commands-python3
Rewrite few or some Linux commands in python 3 to teach python.

I'm teaching myself python 3 and Django, and the best way to learn something is by doing.
So, here I'm trying to rewrite some of linux shell commands in python 3, and anyone welcome to update or edit my scripts.

As I said, this repository is to help in learning python 3.
