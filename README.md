# linux-commands-python3
Rewrite few or some Linux commands in python 3 to teach python.

I'm teaching myself python 3 and Django, and the best way to learn something is by doing.
So, here I'm trying to rewrite some of linux shell commands in python 3 (ex. cat, find, grep, ...), and anyone welcome to update or edit my scripts.

As I said, this repository is to help in learning python 3.

Also, as an Intermediate Programmer, I'm following the first 3 python zen rules:

    1- Beautiful is better than ugly.
    2- Explicit is better than implicit.
    3- Simple is better than complex.

This repository is just started, one script is created at a time, with a very minimum functionality, and it get updated once a new functionality has been learnt and ready to be added.
