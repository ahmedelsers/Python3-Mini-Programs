# Python3 Mini Programs

I'm teaching myself python 3 and Django, and the best way to learn something is by doing.
So, here I'm writing some mini programs along my journy with python 3, and anyone is welcome to update or edit any of my scripts.

As I said, this repository is to help in learning python 3, as I show how I solved the mini problems I got in hand.

Also, as an Bigenner/Intermediate Programmer, I'm following the first 3 python zen rules:

    1- Beautiful is better than ugly.
    2- Explicit is better than implicit.
    3- Simple is better than complex.

I hope the idea get liked by others, and anyone are welcome to edit any of the scripts here, or add his/her own.

Thank You.
