# Python3 Mini Programs

I'm teaching myself python 3 and Django, and the best way to learn something is by doing.
So, here I'm trying to write some mini programs along with my journy in python 3, and anyone welcome to update or edit my scripts.

As I said, this repository is to help in learning python 3, as I show how I solved the mini problems I got in hand.

Also, as an Bigenner/Intermediate Programmer, I'm following the first 3 python zen rules:

    1- Beautiful is better than ugly.
    2- Explicit is better than implicit.
    3- Simple is better than complex.

I hope the idea get liked by others, and anyone are welcome to edit any of the scripts here, or add his/her own.

Thank You.
